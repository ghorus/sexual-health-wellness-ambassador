            <h3 class="header">What exactly is sexual health?</h3>
            <p>Sexual health is the ability of women and men to enjoy and express their sexuality and to do so free from the risk of sexually
                transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancy, coercion, violence, and discrimination. In order to be sexually healthy,
                one must be able to have informed, enjoyable sex base on self-esteem, a positive approach to human sexuality, and mutual respect 
                in sexual relations. Sexually healthy experiences enhance life quality and pleasure, personal relationships and communication, and 
                the expression of one's identity.

            <h3 class="header">What are STIs?</h3>
            <p>Sexually transmitted infections, sometimes abbreviated as STIs or STDs, are common infections that spread from one person to another during
                sex. They're so common that most sexually active people will get at least one in their lifetime. Often there are no symptoms, but if left 
                untreated, STIs can cause serious health issues, and in some cases, death.
            </p>
            <p>Not all STIs are transmitted the same way. Some STIs, like gonorrhea and chlamydia, are transmitted by bodily fluids. Other STIs, like syphilis 
                or herpes, are passed by skin-to-skin contact.
            </p>
            <p>The good news is that all STIs, including HIV, are treatable, and many are curable.</p>

            <h3 class="header">I don't feel comfortable talking about sexual health topics!</h3>
            <p>You should never feel embarassed to talk about your sexal health with a parent or healthcare professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                We get it though. Sexual health can be a difficult topic for anyone to talk about. That's why we developed the Sexual
                Health Welness Ambassador - a chatbot that is unlike any other. It can answer many of your questions about sexual health
                and help you find healthcare services like STI screening or birth control.
